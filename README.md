<h1 align="center">eMailBot</h1>
<p align="center">
    An automated bot that receives all the information from the letter and can send a response letter, and sends bot errors to telegrams (can turn it off if want).
</p>
<br/>

## Quick Start

- Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org) and the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/) package manager installed
- Change the settings for yourself in the `config.yaml` file
- Next, in the terminal, go to the directory with the project and write the command `python main.py`

All is ready! ðŸ¥³

_P.S. The text of the letter is changed in the `server.py` file in the `MailPostman.send_mail` method._
